Squarespace export

## (Re)running the export

We run `mirror.sh` **three times** because Squarespace is finicky and tries to deny access randomly. `wget` will ignore files that have already been retrieved in the subsequent rounds.

One quick way to check if all files are there is to look at the `etching-` files; there should be 23. A complete list of all files (excluding third-party domain page assets) can be found on the [sitemap](https://www.multietch.com/sitemap.xml).

```sh
rm -rf docs && mkdir docs && mkdir docs/files && mkdir docs/files/assets
./mirror.sh && ./mirror.sh && ./mirror.sh
./move.sh
./rewrite.sh
```
